def clean_movements(movements, keep_index=None):
    r"""
    Returns a list of cleaned movement objects.

    For each element of the input `movements` object, detects the existence of
    rows which have i) same x,y-coordinates, or ii) same timestamps.
    For case i), and removes the duplicated rows except for the first.
    For case ii), raises value error.

    Parameters
    ----------
    movements : list
        each element is pandas.DataFrame containing 
        CT, CX, CY coordinates.
        Should have length greater than 1.

    kee_index : boolean
        whether or not keep the original index.
        Deafalt is False.
        If false, cleaned movement object is re-indexed.

    Returns
    -------
    cleaned-movements : list
        each element is cleaned movement object.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> strain_nums = [0,0,1,1,2,2]
    >>> mouse_nums = [0,0,1,1,2,2]
    >>> day_nums = [0,11,0,11,0,11]
    >>> movements = [data.load_movement(strain_num, mouse_num, day_num) for \
    >>> strain_num, mouse_num, day_num in zip(strain_nums, mouse_nums, day_nums)]
    >>> cleaned_movements, num_same_locs = cleaning_movements(movements)
